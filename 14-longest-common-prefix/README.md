# Longest Common Prefix Solution

## Problem Summary
The "Longest Common Prefix" problem involves finding the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. The input is an array of strings, and the output is the longest prefix that is common to all the strings in the array.

## Approach and Rationale
The solution iterates through each character position in the strings, comparing the characters of each string at the current position. If all characters match at the current position, it continues to the next position. If a mismatch is found or a string ends, it terminates and returns the prefix found so far.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: Allocate memory for the result string and initialize the index `i` to 0.
2. **Iterate Through Characters**: For each character position `i`, check the character of the first string.
3. **Compare Across Strings**: For each string in the array, check if the current character matches the character from the first string. If any string ends or a mismatch is found, terminate and return the result.
4. **Build Result**: If all characters match, add the character to the result string and move to the next position.
5. **Termination**: If the loop ends without finding a mismatch, return the result.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In the worst case, the algorithm checks each character of each string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (ignoring the space for the result string). The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space.

## Key Test Cases
1. **Basic Case**: `["flower", "flow", "flight"]` should return `"fl"`.
2. **No Common Prefix**: `["dog", "racecar", "car"]` should return `""`.
3. **One String**: `["hello"]` should return `"hello"`.
4. **Empty Array**: `[]` should return `""`.
5. **All Empty Strings**: `["", "", ""]` should return `""`.

## Extra Insights or Gotchas
- **Memory Allocation**: The solution allocates a fixed size for the result string (`201 * sizeof(char)`). This should be sufficient for most cases but can be optimized based on the actual input size.
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure to handle cases where the array is empty or contains only empty strings.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm is efficient for small to moderate-sized inputs. For very large inputs, consider more advanced techniques to optimize performance.

The solution is straightforward and works well for the given problem constraints.
