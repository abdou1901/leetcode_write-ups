# Multiply Strings in C

This solution solves the "Multiply Strings" problem from LeetCode. The problem involves multiplying two large numbers represented as strings without converting them to integers.

## Problem Summary

**Input:**
- Two strings `num1` and `num2` representing non-negative integers.

**Output:**
- A string representing the product of the input numbers.

**Constraints:**
- The length of both `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to 200.
- The numbers do not contain any leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.
- You should not use the built-in BigInteger library or directly convert strings to integers.

## Approach and Rationale

The approach involves simulating the multiplication of two large numbers digit by digit, similar to how multiplication is performed manually.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Determine the lengths of the input strings.
   - Allocate memory for the result string, which can be as long as the sum of the lengths of the input strings plus one.
   - Initialize the result and a temporary result string to hold intermediate multiplication results.

2. **Multiplication and Accumulation:**
   - Multiply each digit of `num1` by each digit of `num2` starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).
   - Accumulate the resultant values in a temporary result string, considering the carry from previous multiplications.
   - Shift the temporary result to the left by the appropriate number of places before adding it to the final result to account for the place value.

3. **Handling Carry:**
   - Properly manage the carry during the addition of the temporary result to the final result.
   - Ensure that any carry that extends beyond the current length of the result is handled correctly.

4. **Result Trimming:**
   - Remove leading zeros from the final result before returning it.

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n * m), where `n` is the length of `num1` and `m` is the length of `num2`. This is because each digit of `num1` is multiplied by each digit of `num2`, and then the results are summed up.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n + m) due to the additional space required for the result string and the temporary result string.

## Key Test Cases

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Both `num1` and `num2` are "0".
  - One of the inputs is "0".
  - Both inputs are single-digit numbers.
  - One of the inputs is a single-digit number, and the other is a large number.
  - Both inputs are large numbers (close to the max length constraint).

- **General Cases:**
  - Regular multiplication of two numbers with varying lengths.
  - Numbers with repeated digits.
  - Numbers with repeated sequences (e.g., "123123" and "321321").

## Extra Insights or Gotchas

- **Memory Management:**
  Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks.
  The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory, but there is no corresponding `free` to deallocate it, which could lead to memory leaks.

- **Efficiency:**
  The approach is efficient for the given constraints, but for much larger inputs, consider optimized algorithms or libraries specifically designed for large number arithmetic.

- **Edge Handling:**
  Handle edge cases, such as when the result is "0", by carefully managing leading zeros and ensuring the result is correctly trimmed.

- **Potential Optimizations:**
  If performance is critical, consider using a more sophisticated multiplication algorithm, such as Karatsuba or Toom-Cook, which can reduce the time complexity for very large numbers.
